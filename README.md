# README for RouletteSimulation

## Project Overview

RouletteSimulation is a Python-based project designed to simulate a series of roulette games. The purpose of this project is to provide a simple and interactive way to understand the dynamics of betting in roulette, including the distribution of wins and losses over a specified number of games. This simulation allows users to place bets on various outcomes and see the resulting balance after a series of spins.

## Features

- User input for the number of simulations and bet amounts on different roulette outcomes.
- Simulation of roulette spins with random outcomes.
- Calculation of payouts based on the bets placed and the results of each spin.
- Tracking of the number of times red, black, and green (zero) occur.
- Calculation of the average final balance after the specified number of simulations.

## Input Instructions

When prompted, enter the following information:

- `Enter the number of simulations:` The number of times you want the roulette game to be simulated.
- `Amount on Red:` The amount of money you want to bet on red.
- `Amount on Black:` The amount of money you want to bet on black.
- `Amount on Even:` The amount of money you want to bet on even numbers.
- ... (and so on for each betting option).
